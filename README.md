## Description
The begginings of my portfolio this version has three sections Portfolio, 
About Me and Contact Me. 
It utilizes JavaScript ES6, FlexBox, CSS 3 and HTML 5 (Semantic HTML)
I learned through trial and error how to animate in CSS using a checkbox, hiding it then using the label for it as a button then with a little connected JS you have a pop out menu.
I also learned organizing and making sure your script.js is in your repo is key to making sure it works.
It solves the problem that I currently hadno way of show casing my work and now folks can see that I am starting to get somewhere.

## Instalation
- Open my Git Repo (you may already be here)
- click the green code button and and copy the SSH link
- navigate to an empty directory in your terminal or create a new one using mkdir and cd into it
- in your terminal type git copy then paste the SSH link from previous step and click enter
- then you can either open it in finder/explorer or use the code . shortcut to open it in vsc

## Usage
You can see my work done so far in the portfolio section pictured below:
